# This class allows orders with eager-loaded adjustment objects to calculate various adjustment
# types without triggering additional queries.
#
# For example; `order.adjustments.shipping.sum(:amount)` would normally trigger a new query
# regardless of whether or not adjustments have been preloaded, as `#shipping` is an adjustment
# scope, eg; `scope :shipping, where(originator_type: 'Spree::ShippingMethod')`.
#
# Here the adjustment scopes are moved to a shared module, and `adjustments.loaded?` is used to
# check if the objects have already been fetched and initialized. If they have, `order.adjustments`
# will be an Array, and we can select the required objects without hitting the database. If not, it
# will fetch the adjustments via their scopes as normal.
