# Encapsulates the SQL statement that computes the balance of an order as a new column in the result
# set. This can then be reused chaining it with the ActiveRecord::Relation objects you pass in the
# constructor.

# Alternatively, you can get the SQL by calling #statement, which is suitable for more complex
# cases.

# See CompleteOrdersWithBalance or CustomersWithBalance as examples.
