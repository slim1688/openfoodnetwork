# Configure Spree Preferences
#
# Note: Initializing preferences available within the Admin will overwrite any changes that were made through the user interface when you restart.
#       If you would like users to be able to update a setting with the Admin it should NOT be set here.
#
# In order to initialize a setting do:
# config.setting_name = 'new value'

require 'spree/core'

# Due to a bug in ActiveRecord we need to load the tagging code in Gateway which
# should have inherited it from its parent PaymentMethod.
# We have to call it before loading the PaymentMethod decorator because the
# tagging code won't load twice within the inheritance chain.
