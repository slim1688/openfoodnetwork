# Code of Conduct of the Open Food Network

**Welcome!** We are currently working on a Code of Conduct. You are welcome to contribute. We started this work at the Global Gathering 2020 and you find [notes of the initial session](https://community.openfoodnetwork.org/t/global-gathering-2020-day-5-a-code-of-conduct-for-ofn/2071/1) in the community forum. You can edit this file on Github to suggest new content. Alternatively, you can post in our [community forum](https://community.openfoodnetwork.org) or reach us on [Slack](https://openfoodnetwork.org/slack-invite).
